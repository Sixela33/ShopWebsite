# TradeNetwork

A Social Network Built with React and Express

I made this project to demostrate my Javascript skills.
The webpage begun as a E-commerce website but while I was developing it I got the idea of a social network where the users could trade their posts between each other.

The website is functional and it does evrything I planned and more, I didn't emphasize in UX Design because I'm not very good at it hehe, but the webpage is fully responsive.
